                        <br><br>
                        <p class="timeline-text">If you don’t have time to trade your funds or you think that you don’t
                            have enough knowledge and experience, then it’s recommended that you get your funds managed
                            by a forex investment platform. You can be an individual investor or a hedge fund company
                            looking to diversify its savings in the Forex Market without having to be involved in direct
                            managing of your funds.</p>

                        <div class="timeline-title">Why you should let CitiGroup Invest manage your forext
                            investment?</div>
                            <br><br>

                        <p class="timeline-text">
                            The main reason to let CitiGroup Invest manage your Forex investment is to have safe and
                            long term steady profitable performance.</p>
                            <br><br>
                        <p class="timeline-text">1. Forex Market is a 24/7 open market and is a worldwide market, so
                            trading is continuous as long as there is any open market in any world’s country.</p>
                            <br><br>


                        <p class="timeline-text">2. Forex market has high liquidity. With this, we can move large
                            amounts of money into and out of foreign currency with a minimal price movement. Transaction
                            Costs in the Forex Market are very low.The cost of each transaction is built into the price
                            in Forex. It is technically called ‘spread’. The spread is the calculation of the difference
                            between the buying and selling price.</p>
                            <br><br>
                        <p class="timeline-text">3. Leverage can be used in Forex Market. Leverage is the capability to
                            trade more money on the market than what is in your account. Brokers in Forex allow traders
                            to trade the market using different leverages. For example, if you would trade at 100:1
                            leverage, you could trade $100 on the market for every $1 that was in your account. It means
                            that you could control a trade of $100,000 using only $1,000 of capital.</p>
                            <br><br>
                        <p class="timeline-text">4. The potential profits should be weighted about the risk you assume
                            to achieve them. 24/5 open market can also mean that a movement against your profits could
                            happen while you are not watching the screen. In most markets great liquidity could be
                            available when you don’t need it and limited when you require it. Leverage gives you a good
                            feeling when a trade is working in your favor, but it usually makes things worse if you
                            don’t have a professional plan to get out of a losing position.</p>
                            <br><br>

                        <p class="timeline-text">As you can see the advantages of investing in Forex can turn against
                            you easily if you are not a professional trader. That’s why is very important to avoid
                            risking your funds trying to control such a complex market and better choose a professional
                            Forex investment company in order to control, manage and make your funds grow. Keep your
                            funds safe from the beginning and let the professional asset managers do what they know and
                            love to do. Ensure annual steady good Forex profits every year, while you enjoy your life
                            doing your regular work, being with friends, traveling, etc. Let Asset managers manage your
                            Forex Investments and have the complete peace of mind that means working with a professional
                            online investment company like CitiGroup Invest.</p>
